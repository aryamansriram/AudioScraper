# AudioScraper

## Steps to run:

- Clone the repo to your system
- Preferably make a conda environment and download the dependencies in the requirements.txt file
- Change the links and the speaker name in the config file
- Run the playlist link collector. You will see that the links.txt file will have a collection of links of the videos in the playlist.
- Now run the main.py file to download your videos.
